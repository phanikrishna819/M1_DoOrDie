# Requirements
## Introduction
"Do or Die" is a game, we have to guess the output by selecting a case and entering two numbers. The user will be awarded with one chance. This game is purely based on simple math.

## Research
The source code is to be compiled in Code::Blocks with gcc compiler. We can run this code using visual studio, The source code for this project is around 150 lines
## Cost and Features
Our game is simple, it mainly tests the users attention towards the game by creating simple math. This game is completely based on luck as user will be awarded with only one opportunity. 
## Defining Our System
System basically takes the input from the user and registers the case according to the input of the user. Later it will ask usser to select the numbers according to the case that he has choosen. This is a challenging game where user have to think before he give the numbers to match the exact output.
## 4W's and 1H
### Who
for all age category people who are interested in playing math games
### What
project, a number of cases will be available, user has to select one and if he guess the correct answer he will be awarded.
### When
During the step-In training, this is the project assessment that has started.
### Where
This can be used anywhere, any age category can use it.
### How
users can use this code for understanding of a basic math game.
